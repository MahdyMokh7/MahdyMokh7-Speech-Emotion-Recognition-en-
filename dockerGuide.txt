## 1. Build a Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t <image_name> .
```


## 2. List Docker Images

```bash
docker images
```


## 3. Run a Docker Image

```bash
docker run -it <image_name>
```


## 4. Delete a Docker Image

### List Images to Get the Image ID
```bash
docker images
```

### Delete the Image
Once you know the image ID, use the following command:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

### Force Deletion
If the image is being used by any container, you can force the removal using the `-f` flag:

```bash
docker rmi -f <image_id>
```

## 5. Stop and Remove a Running Container
To stop a running container, use:

```bash
docker ps
```

This will show the list of running containers with their IDs.

Then stop the container:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

To remove the stopped container:

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

## 6. Clean Up Unused Docker Resources (Optional)
To remove any dangling images (images that are not tagged or associated with any container), use:

```bash
docker image prune
```

This will delete unused images to free up disk space.
