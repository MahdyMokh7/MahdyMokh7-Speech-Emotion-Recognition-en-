Feature,Description
Spectral Centroid,Describes the center of gravity of the sound's frequency content. It reflects where the 'brightness' or focus of the sound is located along the spectrum.
Spectral Bandwidth,Indicates how wide the frequency content is spread around the centroid. It tells us how concentrated or diverse the frequencies are in a sound.
Spectral Rolloff,Represents the frequency below which a defined percentage of the total energy lies. It gives an idea of how the energy is distributed in the lower vs higher frequencies.
Spectral Contrast,Measures the difference between the peaks and valleys of the spectrum in each frequency band. It captures the texture or sharpness of the sound.
Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR),Counts how frequently the audio signal crosses the zero amplitude line. It reflects the noisiness or granularity of the sound wave.
