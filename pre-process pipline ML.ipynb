    "### Used Functions For Pre-processing Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using these specific functinsfor our pre-processing pipeline for *traditional ML speech emotion recognition* on the **CREMA-D dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`load_and_resample_audio(file_path, sr=TARGET_SR)`**  \n",
    "**Reason for using:**  \n",
    "- Ensures all audio files have the same sampling rate (e.g., 16kHz).  \n",
    "- Different recordings might have varying sample rates, which makes feature extraction (like MFCC, Chroma, etc.) inconsistent.  \n",
    "- Having a consistent `sr` allows uniform time and frequency resolution for all extracted features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*In short: Without uniform sampling rate, features would not be comparable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`convert_to_mono(audio)`**  \n",
    "**Reason for using:**  \n",
    "- CREMA-D clips can be stereo.  \n",
    "- Traditional audio feature extraction (MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Contrast) works on mono signals — stereo channels can cause duplication and confusion.  \n",
    "- Mono conversion simplifies the signal and avoids unnecessary complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Mono ensures one clean signal for consistent, meaningful feature extraction.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`trim_silence(audio, top_db=SILENCE_TOP_DB)`**  \n",
    "**Reason for using:**  \n",
    "- Light silence trimming (e.g., `top_db=40`) removes long, unnecessary silences at the beginning and end.  \n",
    "- Long silences would inflate feature lengths or distort statistics (for features like zero-crossing rate or spectral entropy).  \n",
    "- But trimming is gentle, so we don’t remove emotional pauses inside the speech.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Helps keep the audio focused on speech content, improving feature quality.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`normalize_audio(audio)`**  \n",
    "**Reason for using:**  \n",
    "- Normalizes audio so that its peak amplitude is 1.  \n",
    "- Feature extractors are amplitude-sensitive (especially energy-based features).  \n",
    "- Without normalization, two identical speech samples at different recording volumes could look like different emotional intensities.  \n",
    "- Peak normalization maintains relative loudness dynamics but makes the scale consistent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Eliminates unwanted loudness variations while preserving natural expressive dynamics.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`apply_highpass_filter(audio, sr, cutoff=HIGHPASS_CUTOFF)`**  \n",
    "**Reason for using:**  \n",
    "- Removes low-frequency hums and rumble below 80Hz (e.g., air conditioning noise, mic stand vibrations).  \n",
    "- These low frequencies are *not useful* for emotion; emotion features live in mid- and high-frequency ranges (pitch, formants, harmonics).  \n",
    "- Prevents “pollution” of features like MFCC or spectral contrast by meaningless low-frequency noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Keeps the frequency content clean and relevant for speech emotion features.*\n"

    "\n",
    "The below functions that you will see on the next python cell are the function that we could've used but decided not to use for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Noise Reduction**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we avoided it:**  \n",
    "- CREMA-D is a *studio-recorded* dataset with relatively clean audio;  \n",
    "- Noise reduction algorithms can sometimes distort the natural tone of speech, which is critical for emotion recognition;  \n",
    "- Risk of over-smoothing, harming features like pitch variance or spectral dynamics that are crucial for emotion detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Extreme Silence Removal (aggressive trimming)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we avoided it:**  \n",
    "- Too aggressive silence removal could cut natural pauses that carry emotional cues (hesitation, sighs, or dramatic pauses).  \n",
    "- Emotion detection benefits from subtle prosody and timing variations.  \n",
    "- We stuck to `top_db=40` light trimming instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Volume Standardization (RMS normalization)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why avoided:**  \n",
    "- RMS normalization can distort amplitude-based features like loudness, which are *strong indicators* of emotion (e.g., anger vs. calm).  \n",
    "- Peak normalization was chosen to preserve relative dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Band-Pass Filtering (instead of high-pass)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why avoided:**  \n",
    "- CREMA-D recordings already have controlled frequency ranges.  \n",
    "- Over-filtering could remove important frequency components (high frequencies carry stress, low frequencies carry warmth).  \n",
    "- High-pass filter (80Hz) was enough to clean up low rumble without cutting expressive content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Time-Stretch or Pitch-Shifting (Data Augmentation)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "These are great for training large neural models but **not suitable** at preprocessing for ML feature extraction.  \n",
    "- Feature extraction should happen on clean, original audio.  \n",
    "- Augmentation could introduce bias or misrepresent real emotional cues.\n",
